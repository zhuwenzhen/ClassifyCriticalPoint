ClassifyCriticalPoint
=====================

This project was inspired when I was taking Multivariable Calculus class in my freshman year. An important problem in multivariable calculus is to find the extrema of a multivariable function. Extrema is the most basic feature of the graph of a function, including maxima, minima, and saddle points. ClassifyCriticalPoints[function, vars] can find the critical points of a multivariable function and classify them.
